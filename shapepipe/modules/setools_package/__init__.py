"""SETOOLS PACKAGE.

This package contains the module(s) for ``setools``.

:Author: Axel Guinot

:Parent module: ``sextractor_runner``

:Input: ``SExtractor`` catalogue

:Output: ``SExtractor`` catalogue

Description
===========

This module defines samples via selection criteria, or masks. A variety of statistical
mathematical functions are implemented, that can be applied to the input catalogue.

The ``setools`` module can create random sub-sample output catalogues, for example
for training and validation purposes.

In addition, the module can produce user-defined plots, and compute summary
statistics of the selected population(s). The figures include scatter plots and histograms,
the summaries are number, mean, mode, extrema, and standard deviation.


Module-specific config file entries
===================================
SETOOLS_CONFIG_PATH : str
    path to setools configuration file

Setools configuration file
==========================

This file can contain an arbitrary number of sections. Each section is initiated by a line
``[TYPE:name]``. The following mask types ``TYPE`` are valid:
    - ``MASK``: define a selection or mask
    - ``RAND_SPLIT``: split an input into random subsamples
    - ``PLOT``: create a plot
    - ``STATS``: output summary statistics
``name`` is the file name, in which the result of the section is saved.
This is a FITS file for ``MASK``, .png file for ``PLOT``, and an ASCII file for ``STATS``.
For ``TYPE = MASK`` and ``RAND_SPLIT, ``name`` is also the reference, by which the defined
sample can be addressed within the configuration file.

The following is an example of a star selection using two ``MASK`` sections.
First, a pre-selection is defined:

[MASK:preselect]
MAG_AUTO > 0
MAG_AUTO < 21
FWHM_IMAGE > 0.3 / 0.187
FWHM_IMAGE < 1.5 / 0.187
FLAGS == 0
IMAFLAGS_ISO == 0
NO_SAVE

This selects objects within a magnitude (``MAG_AUTO``) and size (``FWHM_IMAGE``) ranges.
The size limits of 0.3" and 1.5" are transformed from arcseconds to pixels.
Additional flag criteria for ``FLAGS`` AND ``IMAFLAGS_ISO`` are specified.
The keyword ``NO_SAVE`` indicates that this selection is not to be saved to disk.

Next, the final star selection is defined:

[MASK:star_selection]
MAG_AUTO > 18.
MAG_AUTO < 22.
FWHM_IMAGE <= mode(FWHM_IMAGE{preselect}) + 0.2
FWHM_IMAGE >= mode(FWHM_IMAGE{preselect}) - 0.2
FLAGS == 0
IMAFLAGS_ISO == 0

The size range is now refined using the mode of preselected objects. The preselection
removes outliers before the mode computation.

An example of the definition of random subsamples is as follows:

[RAND_SPLIT:star_split]
RATIO = 20
MASK = star_selection

This uses as input the ``star_selection`` sample (given by the ``MASK`` entry).
It creates two random subsamples: one with 20% and one with 80% (100 - RATIO)
percent of input objects. The output file base names are given by the mask name and
the ratios; in this case two files ``star_split_ratio_20-<num>.fits`` and
``star_split_ratio_80-<num>.fits`` are created, where ``<num>`` is the pipeline
number of the (single-exposure single-HDU) image that is processed.

Entries in the ``MASK`` and ``STATS`` sections, lines can contain basic relational operations, and functions.
The operands can be
  - input column names, or ``SExtractor`` keywords
  - names defined by a previous mask.


The following are illustration of two plots. First, another mask
is defined:

[MASK:fwhm_mag_cut]
FWHM_IMAGE > 0
FWHM_IMAGE < 40
MAG_AUTO < 35
FLAGS == 0
IMAFLAGS_ISO == 0
NO_SAVE


[PLOT:size_mag]
TYPE = plot
FORMAT = png
X_1 = FWHM_IMAGE{fwhm_mag_cut}
Y_1 = MAG_AUTO{fwhm_mag_cut}
X_2 = FWHM_IMAGE{star_selection}
Y_2 = MAG_AUTO{star_selection}
MARKER_1 = +
MARKER_2 = .
MARKERSIZE_1 = 3
MARKERSIZE_2 = 3
LABEL_1 = All
LABEL_2 = "Stars, mean FWHM: @mean(FWHM_IMAGE{star_selection})*0.187@ arcsec"
TITLE = "Stellar locus"
XLABEL = "FWHM (pix)"
YLABEL = Mag

[PLOT:hist_mag_stars]
TYPE = hist
FORMAT = png
Y = MAG_AUTO{star_selection}
BIN = 20
LABEL = "stars"
XLABEL = "Magnitude"
YLABEL = "Number"
TITLE = "Magnitude of stars"


Possible values for ``TYPE`` are ``plot``, ``histogram``, ``scatter``.
More than one sample can be plotted by adding ``_1``, ``_2``, ... to all of the above given keywords.

Keywords for all plot types:
Y : str
    functions of samples to plot on y-axis
XLABEL, YLABEL : str, optional, default=None
    labels for x- and y-axes, respectively
LABEL : str, optional, default=no label
    plot label
TITLE : str, optional, default=''
    plot title
ALPHA : float, default=None
    alpha (transparency) parameter
COLOR : str, optional, default=None (standard matplotlib color sequence)
    plot color
FORMAT : str, optional, default='png'
    output file format

Keywords for standard and scatter plots (``TYPE`` in ``plot``, ``scatter``)
X : str
    functions of samples to plot on x-axis
MARKER : str, optional, default='+'
    point marker symbol

Additional keywords for standard line/points plot (``TYPE = plot``)
MARKERSIZE : float, optional, default=1
    marker size
LINE : str, optional, default='' (no line is drawn)
    line type

Additional keywords for histograms (``TYPE = hist``):
BIN : int, optional, default=50
    number of bins
HTYPE : str, optional, default='bar'
    histogram type
LOG : bool

Additional keywords for scatter plots (``TYPE = scatter``):
MARKER : str
    point marker
SCATTER : str, optional, default=None
    function of some input sample acting as third variable
    that is color-coded in the point colors.

Description
===========

This module uncompresses FITS files (e.g. images, weights, flags), and ignores
dummy HDUs with no image data. The compressed FITS weight images contain
a primary empty HDU #0 that will interfere with further processing with
ShapePipe. The uncompressed image is saved as FITS file with a single image
HDU.

Module-specific config file entries
===================================

HDU_DATA : int, optional
    HDU number of input data; the default value is ``0``
OUTPUT_PATTERN : str
    Output file pattern

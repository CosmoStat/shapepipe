# ShapePipe Scripts

These scripts are used to process pipeline products and do not require job
handling (*i.e.* they can be run in serial).

Non-Python scripts (*e.g.* bash, csh, *etc.*) should be placed in the `bin`
directory, while Python scripts and corresponding library modules should be
placed in `python`.

# Parameter description:
#
#
# [INPUTS]
# INPUT_DIR : (Required) Must be a valid directory containing the input
#              MCCD files.
# INPUT_REGEX_FILE_PATTERN : File pattern of the input files to use. It should
#                            follow regex (regular expression) standards.
# INPUT_SEPARATOR : Separator of the different fields in the filename,
#                   ie sexcat[SEP]catalog_id[SEP]CCD_id.fits
# MIN_N_STARS : Minimum number of stars to keep a CCD for the training.
# OUTLIER_STD_MAX : Maximum standard deviation used for the outlier rejection.
#                   Should not be too low as a hihg quantity of low quality
#                   stars will be rejected. ie 9 is a conservative rejection.
# USE_SNR_WEIGHTS : Boolean to determine if the SNR weighting strategy will
#                   be used.
#                   For now, it needs the SNR estimations from SExtractor.
# PREPROCESSED_OUTPUT_DIR : (Required) Must be a valid directory to write the
#                           preprocessed input files.
# OUTPUT_DIR : (Required) Must be a valid directory to write the output files.
#              The constructed models will be saved.
#
#
# [INSTANCE]
# N_COMP_LOC : Number of components of the Local model. If LOC_MODEL is poly,
#              will be the max degree D of the polynomial.
# D_COMP_GLOB : Max degree of the global polynomial model.
# KSIG_LOC : Denoising parameter of the local model.
#            ie 1 is a normal denoising, 3 is a hard denoising.
# KSIG_GLOB : Denoising parameter of the global model.
#             ie 1 is a normal denoising, 3 is a hard denoising.
# FILTER_PATH : Path for predefined filters.
# D_HYB_LOC : Degree of the polynomial component for the local part in case
#             the LOC_MODEL used is 'hybrid'.
# MIN_D_COMP_GLOB : The minimum degree of the polynomial for the global
#                   component. For example, if the paramter is set to 1, the
#                   polynomials of degree 0 and 1 will be excluded from the
#                   global polynomial variations. ``None`` means that we are
#                   not excluding any degree.
# RMSE_THRESH : Parameter concerning the CCD outlier rejection. Once the PSF
#               model is calculated we perform an outlier check on the training
#               stars. We divide each star in two parts with a given circle.
#               The inner part corresponds to the most of the PSF/star energy
#               while the outer part corresponds to the observation background.
#               The outer part is used to calculate the noise level and the inner
#               part to calculate the model residual
#               (star observation - PSF model reconstruction). If the RMSE error
#               of the residual divided by the noise level is over the RMSE_THRESH,
#               the star will be considered an outlier. A perfect reconstruction
#               would have RMSE_THRESH equal to 1.
# CCD_STAR_THRESH : Parameter concerning the CCD outlier rejection. If the
#                   percentage of outlier stars in a single CCD is bigger than
#                   CCD_STAR_THRESH, the CCD is considered to be an outlier.
#                   In this case, the CCD is rejected from the PSF model.
#                   A value lower than 0 means that no outlier rejection
#                   will be done.

# [FIT]
# LOC_MODEL : Defines the type of local model to use, it can be: 'rca',
#             'poly' or 'hybrid'.
#             When the poly model is used, N_COMP_LOC should be used
#             as the D_LOC (max degree of the poly model)
# PSF_SIZE : First guess of the PSF size. A size estimation is done anyways.
# PSF_SIZE_TYPE : Type of the size information. It can be: fwhm, R2, sigma
# N_EIGENVECTS : Number of eigenvectors to keep for the graph constraint
#                construction.
# N_ITER_RCA : Number of global epochs in the algorithm. Alternation between
#              global and local estimations.
# N_ITER_GLOB : Number of epochs for each global optimization. Alternations
#               between A_GLOB and S_GLOB.
# N_ITER_LOC : Number of epochs for each local optimization. Alternations
#              between the different A_LOC and S_LOC.
# NB_SUBITER_S_LOC : Iterations for the optimization algorithm over S_LOC.
# NB_SUBITER_A_LOC : Iterations for the optimization algorithm over A_LOC.
# NB_SUBITER_S_GLOB : Iterations for the optimization algorithm over S_GLOB.
# NB_SUBITER_A_GLOB : Iterations for the optimization algorithm over A_GLOB.

# [VALIDATION]
# MODEL_INPUT_DIR : (Required) Must be a valid directory which contains the
#                   saved trained models.
# VAL_DATA_INPUT_DIR : (Required) Must be a valid directory which contains the
#                      validation input data (test dataset).
# VAL_REGEX_FILE_PATTERN : Same as INPUT_REGEX_FILE_PATTERN but for validation.
# VAL_SEPARATOR : Same as INPUT_SEPARATOR but for validation.
# VAL_OUTPUT_DIR : (Required) Must be a valid directory where to save the
#                  validation outputs, test PSFs and interpolated PSFs.
# APPLY_DEGRADATION : Whether the PSF models should be degraded
#                     (sampling/shifts/flux) to match stars; use True if you
#                     plan on making pixel-based comparisons (residuals etc.).
# MCCD_DEBUG : Debug mode. Returns the local and global contributions.
# GLOBAL_POL_INTERP : Uses polynomial interpolation for the global model
#                     instead of RBF kernel interpolation.

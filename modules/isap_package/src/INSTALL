              ISAP/cxx/sparse1d INSTALL PROCEDURE UNDER UNIX/LINUX/MACOS X/CYGWIN/MINGW
			 this toolbox has never been tested under Windows.

1. PREREQUISITE

  a. Mandatory:

   - C++ compiler.
   - Recent version of CFITSIO need to be first installed (http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio)
     For MAC users, if the port software is installed, the command "sudo port install cfitsio" will install the cfitsio package.
   - Variable ISAP must be defined (ex setenv ISAP /Users/starck/Main/ISAP/ISAP_V2.0)

  b. Optional:
   - Add in your path: $ISAP/bin

2. UNPACK THE ARCHIVE 

  a. Create a directory ISAP_V2.0/cxx or install the ISAP IDL package available at http://jstarck.free.fr/isap.html 
  a. Copy sparse1d.tgz in this directory

  b. Uncompress
     tar xfz sparse1d.tgz

3. BUILDING

  To configure the sparse1d toolbox for your machine type:
        cd sparse1d/build
        cmake ..

    Once CMake is done, to create the toolbox and compile all the C++ files, type:

        make
        make install
        
    The library, headers and executables will respectively be installed in the lib, include and bin folders. 

    You may want to clean the toolbox after the compilation step, type:

    	make clean

4. CLEAN AND REBUILD

  To rebuild the toolbox, just type the following:

        make clean
	make
	make install  
 
5.  ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES

    In order to use sparse1d in the iSAP environment, some environment variables need to be
    defined or extended:
        ISAP              -- standard ISAP variable
        PATH               - extend to include $ISAP/bin
 	
6. BINARY 
    the binaries are in $ISAP/bin
    example: $ISAP/bin/mr1_filter input.fits output.fits

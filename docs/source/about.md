# About

ShapePipe an open-source and modular weak-lensing measurement, analysis and
validation pipeline written in Python.

The current version of ShapePipe starts with reduced survey images and ends by
providing galaxy shape measurements along with all of the information required for
shear calibration. It includes various validation tools and a novel point spread
function (PSF) modelling technique. The code has been designed to facilitate
the inclusion of new or improved processing steps to adapt to advances made
in the coming years.

The primary application of ShapePipe so far has been to the Ultraviolet
Near-Infrared Optical Northern Survey (UNIONS) data (see {cite:t}`guinot:22`
and Kilbinger et al., in prep).

We plan to add features and find new applications for ShapePipe and will update
this documentation accordingly. For more details on the first public release
of ShapePipe please see {cite:t}`farrens:22b`.
